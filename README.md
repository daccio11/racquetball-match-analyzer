# 🏆 Racquetball Match Score Parser: Extracting & Structuring Player Scores

A **Python script** that reads a recorded sequence of **racquetball match scores** from a file and extracts **player names and their respective points** using **regular expressions**. The program calculates the total score for each player and determines the match winner.

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **Tech Used:**
- 🐍 **Python** (Core Language)
- 🔍 **Regex (`re`)** (Pattern Matching)
- 📂 **File Handling** (Reading match data)
- 📝 **String Manipulation** (Processing player names & scores)

This project processes a text-based match record where **player names are embedded with their scores** (e.g., `ben2abby1ben3`). The script **inserts spaces**, splits names and scores, and then uses **regular expressions** to extract structured data. It then **calculates total points for each player and determines the winner**.

## 🎯 **Features:**
✅ **Parses match data from a text file** 📂  
✅ **Extracts player names and scores dynamically** 🔍  
✅ **Uses regex for accurate name-score separation** 🧩  
✅ **Automatically calculates total scores** 📊  
✅ **Determines and prints the match winner** 🏆

## ⚡ **Optimizations**
- **📂 File Handling:** Uses `with open()` for efficient file reading.
- **📝 String Preprocessing:** Inserts spaces before numbers to ensure proper name-score separation.
- **🔍 Regex Matching:** Extracts names and scores reliably.
- **📊 Structured Output:** Displays results in a clear, readable format.
- **🏆 Automated Score Calculation:** Totals scores for each player and determines the winner.
